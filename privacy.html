        <p>Synpas Limited ("Synpas", "we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you as to how we look after your personal data when you visit our website (synpas.com) or use our mobile connectivity services, and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Synpas Limited is a company incorporated in England and Wales. We act as the data controller for your personal data.</p>
        <p><strong>Contact Details:</strong><br>
        Email: hello@synpas.com<br>
        Address: Registered Office, London, United Kingdom.</p>

        <h2>2. The Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect, use, store, and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identity Data:</strong> Includes your email address. We do not require names or passwords for account creation.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Includes internet protocol (IP) address, your login data (magic links), browser type and version, time zone setting and location, and the eSIM device identifier (ICCID/IMEI) required to provision cellular service.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Includes information about how you use our website, data consumption metrics (e.g., amount of data used), and connection duration.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> Includes details about payments to and from you and other details of products you have purchased from us. <strong>Note:</strong> We do not store your credit card details. All financial transactions are processed by third-party payment providers (Stripe/Apple Pay).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To provide the Service:</strong> To provision your eSIM profile and grant access to cellular networks via our infrastructure partners.</li>
            <li><strong>To manage our relationship with you:</strong> Including notifying you about changes to our terms or privacy policy, and providing customer support.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> To verify your identity via email-based "Magic Links" (passwordless login).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Disclosure of Your Data (Third Parties)</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your data. However, to provide our service, we must share specific data with the following categories of third parties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Telecommunications Infrastructure Providers:</strong> We partner with <strong>Gigs GmbH</strong> and other underlying network operators to provide connectivity. Your device identifiers (ICCID) and usage data are processed by these partners to enable network access.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processors:</strong> We use Stripe and Apple Pay to process payments. Financial data is handled directly by them under their own privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Waitlist Management:</strong> We use Airtable to manage our beta waitlist and email communications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. International Transfers</h2>
        <p>Synpas is based in the UK. However, due to the global nature of travel connectivity, your data (specifically Technical and Usage Data) may be transferred to and processed by network operators in the countries where you travel to facilitate your connection.</p>
        <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the specific safeguards approved by the UK Government or European Commission is implemented.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an unauthorized way. In particular, we utilize a "passwordless" architecture to minimize the risk of credential theft.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Legal Rights</h2>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws (UK GDPR) in relation to your personal data, including the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request erasure of your personal data ("Right to be forgotten").</li>
            <li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request restriction of processing your personal data.</li>
            <li>Request transfer of your personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us at support@synpas.com.</p>
