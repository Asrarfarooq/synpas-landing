    <!-- Content -->
    <section class="container legal-content">
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 7, 2025</p>
        
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service") carefully before using the Synpas website and mobile connectivity services (the "Service") operated by Synpas Limited ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.</p>

        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>Synpas provides prepaid mobile data plans via eSIM technology. We act as a reseller of mobile connectivity. The actual network service is provided by third-party mobile network operators and our infrastructure partner, Gigs GmbH.</p>
        <p>We do not own the network infrastructure and cannot guarantee 100% coverage, speed, or availability at all times in all locations.</p>

        <h2>2. Device Compatibility</h2>
        <p>It is your sole responsibility to ensure that your device is <strong>eSIM compatible</strong> and <strong>network unlocked</strong> before purchasing a plan. We provide a list of generally compatible devices, but we cannot be held responsible if your specific device does not work due to carrier locks or hardware limitations.</p>

        <h2>3. Purchases and Payments</h2>
        <p>If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase including your credit card number, the expiration date of your credit card, and your billing address.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete.</p>

        <h2>4. Refund and Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>Due to the nature of digital goods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Before Activation:</strong> If you purchase an eSIM plan but do not install or activate it, you may request a refund within 14 days of purchase.</li>
            <li><strong>After Activation:</strong> Once the eSIM has been installed on your device or data usage has commenced, the service is considered "consumed," and <strong>no refunds</strong> will be issued.</li>
            <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> If the Service is technically defective (e.g., the eSIM cannot connect to the network despite correct settings and a compatible device), we will investigate. If the fault lies with our infrastructure, a full refund will be issued.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Fair Use and Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service for any illegal purpose or in any way that interrupts, damages, or impairs the service. You must not use the Service for excessive roaming that violates the Fair Use Policies of our underlying network partners. We reserve the right to suspend your service immediately if we detect abusive usage patterns or fraudulent activity.</p>

        <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="caps">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall Synpas Limited, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory.</p>
        <p>Specifically, we are not liable for any costs incurred (such as missed flights, travel disruptions, or alternative connectivity costs) arising from a failure of the Service to connect.</p>

        <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>

        <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at hello@synpas.com.</p>
